        <h3>Bachelor of Engineering &mdash; Software (Honours) at University of Queensland</h3>
        <h4>Thesis (Undergraduate)</h4>
        <p>Technology-supported activities through realtime, distributed, and collaborative interfaces</p>
        <p>Abstract</p>
        <p>
        Traditionally user interfaces have been designed for a single user
        using one common device type&mdash;e.g. someone on a computer visiting a website.
        With the internet and mobile devices now being commonplace, interfaces could
        take advantage of being distributed across devices and working collaboratively
        with others in real-time. While there have been attempts to to handle this
        (e.g. Google Docs), they have so far been in a limited, prescribed manner. A
        proposed concept is put forward to design and build a new approach for a
        distributed and real-time collaborative user interface focusing on the concept
        of having a workspace with components that the user is able to freely use in a
        real-time manner. It is based upon existing web browsers and devices. Parts of
        the UI can be distributed across separate platforms. A prototype of a
        workspace for education is included and user testing of the prototype shows
        positive experiences and results for the users.
