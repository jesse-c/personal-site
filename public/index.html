  Abstract: Traditionally user interfaces have been designed for a single
  user using one common device type--e.g. someone on a computer visiting a
  website. With the internet and mobile devices now being commonplace,
  interfaces could take advantage of being distributed across devices and
  working collaboratively with others in real-time. While there have been
  attempts to to handle this (e.g. Google Docs), they have so far been in a
  limited, prescribed manner. A proposed concept is put forward to design
  and build a new approach for a distributed and real-time collaborative
  user interface focusing on the concept of having a workspace with
  components that the user is able to freely use in a real-time manner. It
  is based upon existing web browsers and devices. Parts of the UI can be
  distributed across separate platforms. A prototype of a workspace for
  education is included and user testing of the prototype shows positive
  experiences and results for the users.
