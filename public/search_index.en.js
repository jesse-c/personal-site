While there have been attempts to to handle this\n    (e.g. Google Docs), they have so far been in a limited, prescribed manner. A\n    proposed concept is put forward to design and build a new approach for a\n    distributed and real-time collaborative user interface focusing on the concept\n    of having a workspace with components that the user is able to freely use in a\n    real-time manner. It is based upon existing web browsers and devices. Parts of\n    the UI can be distributed across separate platforms.

I interact with SABnzbd through its web UI, Raycast, and NZBHydra 2. There may even be another way that I'm not remembering.\nThe paradigm I thought of from this, and added to my projects list, was something like this:\n\nThe name that I gave the project/idea was \"headless for everything\", where headless is the daemon, in that drawing.\nSome clients are local, while some are remote, like \"Export to website\". There are more and more local- and offline-first projects. What if you could export your data to another service? Chuck some local issues/tickets up in Jira and Linear? What if you could E2E as part of that? What if it could realtime, distributed, and collaborative?2\nThe obviousâ€”and hugeâ€”downside is that adding a network in-between brings all the issues that a network inherently has. Maybe Photon will help us out.\nMy first experiment with this paradigm\nThe Pomodoro technique has occasionally worked well for me. On macOS, I use Tomato 2â€”and highly recommend it! A Pomodoro timer became the first experiment for me.\nThe first version used sockets and an SQLite DB with the daemon and CLI client written in Rust. I wanted notifications though and with notarising/signing, I didn't like how I would send native macOS notifications.\nThe second version got rid of SQLite and kept it all in memory to simplify it and used MessagePack.\nThe third version, which is a work-in-progress, gets rid of sockets and uses gRPC for communication so that I can write a client in Swift. I did look around, and it seemed possible to use sockets with Swift, but again, I didn't like how I would've had to do so.\nSample: How-to use gRPC to communicate between Rust &lt;&gt; Swift\nRepository: https://github.com/jesse-c/grpc-example-rust-swift\nWhile I plan on writing a step-by-step tutorial, in the desire to get this idea and sample out to the world, I've published the repository.\n\n1\nI'm still not decided on Raycast. I would go back to Alfred in a heartbeat if it wasn't so visually dated.\n\n2\nMy undergrad thesis was titled Technology-supported activities through realtime, distributed, and collaborative interfaces.\n\n","id":"https://j-e-s-s-e.com/notes/multi-uis-with-grpc/","title":"Multi-UIs for a daemon and using gRPC to communicate locally from Rust <> Swift"},"https://j-e-s-s-e.com/notes/retrospective-on-a-side-project/":{"body":"AutoVolume is a free and open source app that automatically changes the volume when your Mac wakes from sleep. I'm going to give a brief overview from how it started, to being released.\nInitial idea\nFrom my idea.md file for this, one night I had my volume up high because I was watching a TV show, and the next day when I received an email notification it was super loud, which was just a bit shocking and embarrassing. I wrote down the idea of, 'If sleep longer than time period x, show a notification on log in with action to mute'. The end product ended up being similar.\nI took this as an opportunity to do a few other little things that I've been wanting to do: design a website for the the first time in a while, create an animation, and code a website using no IDs or classes.\nFinding time\nI wrote down the idea on 16-06-26 and the first commit to the repository was on 16-12-18.  The most recent commit was on 17-04-05. From having the idea to releasing something took around 10 months. That wasn't because of difficulty in any part, but because it was very low priority to meâ€”and that was okay! \nStaying true to the original idea and a minimum feature set was key as well. It made it easy to release it sooner and evaluate if people would use it, and how.\nA relatively large amount of time was spent on the animation. I searched for different ways to do it (e.g. using an animation code library) and settled on After Effects. While you can easily do it in AE, I was finding parts of the UX (importing lots of layers into AE) tedious. In the end I switched to Photoshop and created the animation in there in a few minutes.\nEvaluation\nThe common saying of build something for your own problem was trueâ€”and it was satisfying seeing people say thank you, and that it was just what they wanted, either knowingly, or after reading what it did. I personally always have it running and have found it useful.\nIt reached the #1 spot on Designer News which was cool to see. Someone posted it to Product Hunt on my behalf as well. I posted it to a private forum I'm apart of as well. What was also satisying was seeing all the people star the repository on GitHub.\nWhat's next\nI already have my own TODO items, but people had suggestions from the get go. For now it does it's purpose and works 'perfectly' in that regard, so I'm going to leave it alone for a bit.\n","id":"https://j-e-s-s-e.com/notes/retrospective-on-a-side-project/","title":"Retrospective on a side-project: AutoVolume for macOS"},"https://j-e-s-s-e.com/notes/serialise-deserialise-enum-from-rust-to-swift/":{"body":"Between Rust and Serde and Swift and Codable, it's relatively easy to serialise and deserialise between the 2, using JSON.
