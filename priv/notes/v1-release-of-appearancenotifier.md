v0.0.1 was released on 2021-06-09[^1]. Since then, I've been using it daily both at home and at work. After a lazy approach to auto-starting it[^2], I added a daemon definition for macOS with `launchd`. Recently as well, I added Emacs support.

With these changes, I remembered to do a release, giving us v1![^3]
