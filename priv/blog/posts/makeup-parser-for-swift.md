Having switched to using Elixir and NimblePublisher for the backend of my personal website, I've needed to improve the availability of Makeup parsers. Firstly, starting with Swift, with [`makeup_swift`](https://github.com/jesse-c/makeup_swift).

It's incredibly bare bones, so far.

The approach so far is to be fairly true to the Swift Language Reference[^1]. The prioritisation is hopefully on the more common parts of the language.

Contributions are heavily welcomed and encouraged!
