Recently I tried Emacs 29[^1] and began slimming down my config[^2]. Following the Tree-sitter starter guide[^3], I couldn't figure out why I wasn't able to start the appropriate mode. I would get errors along the lines of, `Cannot activate tree-sitter, because language definition for ...`.

After double-checking file paths and names, I compared my local build output of the recommend build script[^4] to the provided releaseâ€”which _did_ work .

The provided release was compiled for `x86_64` and my local build output was for `arm64`. That wasn't wrong, as I _am_ on an M1.

Here's the a simple and lazy to compile for `x64_64` and have it work: `arch -x86_64 ./batch.sh`
