With the launch of the Model Context Protocol initiative by Anthropic[^1], I thought I'd try my hand at making one—as did many others, also think to do!

As I use Linear daily, I thought that would be a good target[^2]. Next would be Reminders.app for Linear⟷Reminders.app agentic (?) flows. I've just tagged a `v0.2.0` release, so check it out at [https://github.com/jesse-c/linear-context-server-ts](https://github.com/jesse-c/linear-context-server-ts).
