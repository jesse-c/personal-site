This is the latest, in my ongoing experiments of daemon-first or headless-first[^1][^2][^3] software. This time, it's for my clipboard history, that's turned out to be an invaluable thing to have access ooâ€”much like my shell history. I've created a daemon[^5] and Raycast extension[^6].

Someone has put together a comparison list[^4] of clipboard managers for macOS, that currently has 29 listed! I had been using the built-in Raycast clipboard history, but didn't want to be beholden to that single application.

Using Windsurf, I quickly knocked this together, and it's been working well. Here's a screenshot:

Next, I'll make a CLI wrapper for it, though even now it could be used with cURL.
