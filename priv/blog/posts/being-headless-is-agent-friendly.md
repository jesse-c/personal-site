Recently[^1] I put out another headless-first program. I've improved it a bunch since then, and just before I was working on the private mode feature.

For at least 8 years[^2], I've occasionally had the thought of agents. Today I noticed the similarity about being agent-first and headless-first. Being those, means that you need the data, context, and most importantly, actions _available_ to be called upon. This could be through an MCP client in your editor, or some other agentic flow.

Another WIP side-project about a continuous (AKA ambient) agent. My clipboard history could be a source for that.
