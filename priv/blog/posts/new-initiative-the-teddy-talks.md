Around 3 years ago, a friend of mine told me about something they've been doing, called [The Teddy Talks](https://www.instagram.com/the.teddytalks/). I loved the idea, and have run it annually where I live, for the last 4 years!

Whenever I've spoken about it with new friends or colleagues, almost everyone universally loves the idea. To help spread the initiative, I've launched a simple website this week: [https://www.theteddytalks.com](https://www.theteddytalks.com).
