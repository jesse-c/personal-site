Previously I had hacked together a Magit plugin[^4] for git-spice[^3]. In the meantime, Abhinav Gupta has released official JSON support[^2]!

Following this, I've released an alpha version of git-spice.el[^5]. Feel free to give it a go. There's a good chunk of AI generated code inthere, as a warning. It's now listed on git-spice's website[^1].
