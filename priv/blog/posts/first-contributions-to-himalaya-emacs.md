I've been using Himalaya on-and-off since 2023, and have made a Raycast package for it[^1]. I switched to Emacs a few years ago too, from Neovimâ€”and have probably tried every other editor at some point too.

With the v1 release of Himalaya, and updating my Raycast package for it[^2], I was curious to see what other developments had happened.

That took me to [himalaya-emacs](https://github.com/dantecatalfamo/himalaya-emacs) to which I fixed a tiny bug (with direction from someone else)[^3] and added a new feature[^4].

There's more on the way[^5][^6]!
