There's the _agentic web_ being bandied around now. It may be little more than Web 3.0.

As part of discovering that, you can now connect to my website as it hosts a remote MCP server, at [https://j-e-s-s-e.com/mcp](https://j-e-s-s-e.com/mcp).

For example, you can use `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`, and then put that in as the address, and connect.

There's currently 2 tools:

1. List blog posts
2. Read 1 blog post

There's increasing tooling around preparing locally, the inputs into LLM applications. Hosting a remote MCP server, means that I can do that preparation for users.

What I'm unsure of is discoverability, aside from spiders from the usual companies. We'll see how it goes, and if an industry standard comes about.
