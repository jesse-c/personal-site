description = "I'm using a Homebridge HTTP switch to turn it on and off, and to know the statusâ€”through Homekit (Siri). The issue with turning it on though is that sometimes the TV is in a state where it responds to Wake-on-LAN but not to DIAL requests. This control proxy sends both when turning the TV on."
