    <p>
    Traditionally user interfaces have been designed for a single user
    using one common device type&mdash;e.g. someone on a computer visiting a website.
    With the internet and mobile devices now being commonplace, interfaces could
    take advantage of being distributed across devices and working collaboratively
    with others in real-time. While there have been attempts to to handle this
    (e.g. Google Docs), they have so far been in a limited, prescribed manner. A
    proposed concept is put forward to design and build a new approach for a
    distributed and real-time collaborative user interface focusing on the concept
    of having a workspace with components that the user is able to freely use in a
    real-time manner. It is based upon existing web browsers and devices. Parts of
    the UI can be distributed across separate platforms. A prototype of a
    workspace for education is included and user testing of the prototype shows
    positive experiences and results for the users.
